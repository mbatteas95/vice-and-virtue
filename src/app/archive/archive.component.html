        <p><strong><u>Haruhi</u></strong></p>
        <p>Figures.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>No matter the hour, no matter the season or circumstance, some things never change. He’s consistent in the
          way that a flame dances in the night or a bone breaks. That is to say, he’s consistently <strong>un</strong>predictable
          in all the <i>worst </i>ways. It’s with a lack of conventional means that he thrives within his work, and
          consequently, drives the doctor to absolute fucking madness.</p>

        <p>Filed nails drum against the bar as she waits.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>And waits.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>And—&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Need another drink, ma’am?”</p>

        <p>A vein throbs due to the reminder; he’s three drinks late. Soon, <i>four</i>.&nbsp; “Do you even have to
          ask?”</p>

        <p>Her words are a razor’s edge, but the bartender only clicks his tongue. “... Another island mist, coming
          right up.” His quick response does at least elicit a half-apologetic expression from the hellcat.</p>

        <p>These days, Haruhi’s temper is a mundane affair (now more than ever) since a certain <i>someone </i>worked
          himself into the picture.</p>

        <p><i>‘Damn it; next time I see him, he’s done for.’</i></p>

        <p>She’s the metronome to his melody, the constant to an equation of which neither know the solution. When
          pieces from two different puzzles wedge themselves together, should we raise our fists as they shirk the
          responsibility of the holes they’ve left in their own sets?&nbsp; Or do we admire their tenacity, their drive
          to create something new from the drivel?</p>
        <p>She likes to think that hard work has a way of making all things work out in her favor... eventually.&nbsp;
          After all, even winter bows to the warmth of spring. She tells herself that it’s worth it, but then again, any
          control she had left in her life was relinquished the moment he waltzed in with all the grace of a hurricane
          born of smoke and liquor.</p>
        <p>And christ, if that man isn’t a walking death wish of a vice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Far from any semblance of normalcy, Haruhi’s day-to-day routine guarantees a life of uncertainty— daily
          danger and at least <i>one </i>person either dead or knocking on Death’s Door. Were she sane in any sense of
          the word, the doctor would work to keep her life as close to simplistic as she can manage. She would avoid
          risks as they came, and would <i>certainly </i>keep her distance from him of all people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He’s the type of danger they warn you about. Undetected. Friendly. A handsome fiend with a breath reeking of
          an empty decanter. One look and you should run in the other direction, <i>not </i>jump headfirst into an
          unknown void.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">[Seems someone didn’t get the memo.]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her thumb hovers over his number on her phone, tempted to make the umpteenth call to go unanswered. Today
          marks another day, another testament as to why she shouldn’t put her faith in anyone aside from
          herself.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>But if he hasn’t answered the first five times, why bother? Instead, the woman taps heatedly against the
          screen, beautifully agitated words stringing together with each hurried, temperamental <i>click</i> of nails
          on the glass.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>God dammit, Yuu.</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>“I’ll be there this time, promise.” “I’m sorry, I won’t fail you again.”&nbsp; Lying
          ass. Why did I expect anything less?</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>You’ve got five minutes to get your ass here before I head home and throw your shit
          out the window.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>Don't test me this time. That charm can only get you so far, you bastard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS]</strong> You better have at least picked up fresh veggies for Lola.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Aika</u></strong></p>
        <p>It doesn’t take much for a wry grin to find a way onto her lips; so, he’s <i>that </i>type after all, is he?
          Cut from the same cloth as she; pieces from the same jigsawed paperboard. Gravel crunches beneath her shoes at
          an unfaltering pace, the rhythm of her steps carrying comfortably between them. Attire and position aside, the
          detective accepts her offer without the reproach she expects—<i> of course </i>she’s taken by surprise. Isn’t
          he a man of ethics? Principles? Or is her moral radar becoming rusty with age?</p>

        <p>Or maybe he's just playing along until she’s caught in an illegal— <i>unorthodox</i> act. Was he hired to
          watch her, or was their encounter mere happenstance? Aika exhales, her breath complemented by curling plumes
          of smoke.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>No, no...&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Skylit eyes roam from toe to head, then down again, sizing him up while she pulls another long drag.&nbsp;
          Despite her initially half-teasing tone, he’s taking the cards she’s dealt him and playing her game. He seems
          too sincere now, right?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Either way, she’s interested.</p>

        <p>She’s invested.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>[Translation: <i>He’s </i>in danger.]&nbsp;</p>

        <p>With a quick pinch and flick, ashes fall from the end of her vice, becoming nothing more than cinders swayed
          by wind. “Good. The place is about a kilometer southeast of here. Not opposed to an evening stroll, are ya?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Yuuichi</u></strong></p>
        <p>His phone shuttered within his denim holster, no doubt in his mind what coals of anger lie across the small
          window of light. Just a little longer, stars guiding a spur decision to exist within the midnight. Could say
          something, but anything aside what was happening. Funny, it’s always the opposite of what should be happening.
          Loud clicks against earth rang deep within aching lobes for no solitude in a serenade of filthy expeditions.
          Cautiously, his anxious fingers teased the frozen metal of the barrel within his jacket. A loose rope falling
          so far into the night, thoughts of swallowing the very appendage throbbed within a broken network of neurons.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a certain sickness within his body, and like a toxic ichor it poured forth from his pores. The air
          began to choke him, the ground burning the feet within his loafers. Agony stripped away the happiness drowning
          like a totaled bus full of children on the morning news. It was heavy, the muscle within a weary chest beat
          without a promise of returning the oxygen to his spasming lungs. Angels lended wings for solitude, but only
          vermilion iris returned the gaze and rejected god.</p>

        <p>Now, with a guilty pleasure strung into his very blood, trembling fingers reached around the trigger while
          following the worthless fool down alley and sidewalk. When the sky radiated in such a pale light, it was
          almost impossible to see the souls of anyone anymore. His teeth began to break against one another, each push
          of the molars chipping away at the remaining ceramic. Warm pools of tar seeped against his tongue, nerves
          brushing into the jagged hewn of his canines. The pain was absent, even as sharp knives bore into the fleshy
          fat of his tongue. She would sway as she walked with a carefree loneliness. Such a lost child in a world of
          stranded nobodies. It was hideous but everything someone could possibly want.</p>

        <p>Ah, no. He was the hideous one while choking now. Gripped palms around a milky neck to retrieve what life
          remained in an empty husk.</p>

        <p>A quick snap of her fingers separated the seams, oval rotations bringing her into focus. A short laugh with
          no words, his mind was vacant in a moment of death. Was the end always as opaque as the words? A world so
          perfect burning atop a field of dying flowers and regretful actions. No salvation for the saviors, and no
          money for the poor. A cigarette would be nice after all. He’ll have to take them back before leaving, mental
          note.</p>

        <p>It’s never the same when they look at you before the revelation. Their revelation. Is is pain? Is it
          distress? Or are they looking at him at all?</p>

        <p>It’s a window. A beautiful window that looks beyond what we could see, directly through our perceptions. It’s
          being touched by the beyond, and finally being able to reach back for a fingertip. Those shutters of grace and
          cold, cold breath. It’s never fear. It’s an understanding of the future.</p>
        <p>“ How much farther? “</p>

        <p>At least he had a flask.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Aika</u></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><strong>LESSON 1:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:right;">When dealing in temptation, a succubus always wins.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The curl of her lips hides upon his tonal curiosity. Was that <i>impatience</i>? Something else? With every
          step, their playing field reveals itself; his pawn moves within the sights of her bishop; just another piece
          to be added to her collection. Little does he know, she’s the type to attack from an angle.</p>
        <p>The butt of her cigarette carelessly buries itself in a nearby bush. “Eager beaver, aren’t you? Don’t worry,
          it’s just up ahead.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p>As it stands, she’s certain of one fact above all else —&nbsp;</p>
        <p style=text-align:right;>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style=text-align:right;>He shouldn’t be here.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>And if the pulsing vein of his neck wasn’t clear enough, the incessant buzzing in his coat was hardly a
          subtle indication. All the more reason to keep him strung up on a journey he would not soon forget.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Her game is uncontested, played till submission and ending when she has satiated the clawing hunger of her
          whims. Allure and risqué go hand in hand, parting ‘dedicated’ men from their duties and the <i>righteous</i>
          from their fortitudes. Breaking walls and fading inhibitions, she should be seen as a saint among men; he
          should be <strong>grateful </strong>for the clarity she can bring into his life, even if only for a night.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i>This is her favor.&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A fallen angel offers her hands with palms open, knowing men will concede to self-inflicted crucifixions of
          their own volition. It’s as predictable as it is pathetic; it’s what they deserve. She aims to take what she
          can, and taking <i>advantage </i>is her latest opus as an artist. The only thing guaranteed in life is death,
          so fuck all the rest and at least make the stay enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>And there’s nothing quite like a little B&amp;E, theft, and flesh-to-flesh to liven up a spare
          night.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Brisk breezes skirt along the length of her spine, chilling with the season and growing colder by the night.
          Pale skin prickles in anticipation; the thought of swathing herself in the hot waters of a spring becoming all
          the more enticing. The little-more-than-a stranger beside the artist has her only more eager.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i>Who </i>he is doesn’t matter anyway.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They say there’s power in a name, but what about the ilk gained from vacant mystery? Rather indulge in
          foreign company for a night than let the man become another ghost creeping along her skin. Who is she to deny
          herself the pleasures of her own modus operandi? Each face she collects is obsolescent— just another medal to
          hang around her neck.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>It’s not long until a soothing view breaks between the trees to their left; a vast, breath-taking space
          wrapped by a wooden fence emerging from obscurity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Stay quiet and follow me, alright?” Her steps are as light as her whisper, flowing like tides. Effortless
          hips rock the same way a wave lilts during a full moon; casual grace both learned and natural.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>—</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She’s more than familiar with the place and —unfortunately— the owner (some small-dicked, old money, trust
          fund baby with a nice smile).&nbsp;</p>

        <p>It took all of three drinks for her to gain the access she needs to survey her latest hollowed hole. The rich
          require attention, they <strong>crave </strong>validation as though they are starved by privilege. By the end
          of that night, What’s-his-name was practically <i>begging </i>to take her back to his place.&nbsp; <strong>Dumbass</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Within four hours, she was somewhat content and the ‘innocent’ pillow talk laid all the information she
          needed on a platinum platter. His week days are spent at a town home in Kyoto, where he conducts menial family
          business. (Read: Leaving ample opportunity for her to circumvent his security and ease into a warm soak in the
          springs out back when the need arises.) Weekends are blocked off for parties, save-face events, and the odd
          bar night where he’s itching to mask just how lonely he actually is. He prefers his property along the edges
          of Tokyo because the community here feels like a sanction. Secluded. <i>Safe</i>. With all his business
          elsewhere, security is lax as a testament to living a more ‘humbled’ life. (Fucking idiot, how naive can men
          be?)</p>

        <p>Just how humble is it exactly to be living in some picturesque grotto tucked among the leaves?</p>

        <p>It takes a certain tenacity to tolerate the foibles of the silver spoon-fed for as long as she did; call it a
          gift. But moreover, Aika has done her homework and now it’s time to put what she knows to the test:&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It’s Thursday, so no one’s home.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Three cameras on the east, two west, and one both north and south.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Alarms are only set <i>inside </i>of his house.</li>
          <li>A tree on the north overhangs from the outer perimeter of his onsen. Perfect point of entry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>—</p>

        <p>When they reach the base of said tree, she pivots. A warm glow from a distant light glosses her company’s
          profile, just enough for her to survey his expression for any tells.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i>Nothing.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He’s got her about as intrigued as she is concerned when it comes to his intentions. Cliches aside, he’s as
          mysterious as they come; no doubt leading a man like <i>that </i>into a situation like <i>this </i>is
          borderline idiotic, but...&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:right;">Taken men have always been her undoing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Go ahead,” she tests, “Should be able to jump down onto the other side of the fence from that branch up
          there.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Yuuichi</u></strong></p>
        <p>A test? Beaver? Who taught this wayward girl how to speak? It was like communicating with some of the men
          that Haruhi worked with. Brash, teasing, and confident all tied in with a snug little bow of danger. She gave
          off such an alluring aroma, but something about it felt like chloroform. A sickly feeling took his stomach in
          knots while trying to decipher the female before stepping over the metaphorical edge. Was she the one putting
          them at risk...Or was she?</p>

        <p>A tricky glance at her coquettish figure proved the lions may be out to play from their usual den, tight
          clothes and calculated flirtatious sways teasing his better intentions. Perhaps she wasn’t meant to find a
          friend, but something more. Was the feast for the evening? For so long, all fifty two cards were played from
          his deck. Could someone else really hold the jokers?</p>

        <p>Mobile trials for a trip meant for relaxation was a suffered intention at best. This wasn’t some hole in the
          wall the girl had thought off. As best, this was the pad of a close ally who happened to leave the front
          locked as to deter company. In reality however, the idea of simply breaking and entering fit this lock better
          than any key tried beforehand. What exactly was the plan here?</p>

        <p>Initially, his momentum from avoiding an angry demise was purely self-centered. A few drinks and a moment to
          collect himself away from the chaos closer to the agency was priority. As simple as those requests may be to
          the brain initially, the thoughts began to crumble away at actions taken without second thoughts to further
          investigate the consequences. Shit. A brief glance at his familiar palms rested in what a few glasses could
          not. This was likely a mistake, regardless of the company. It wasn’t about the whiskey or the girl at this
          point. He was ghosting a night away like usual, reliving the idea of how hard old habits are to kill. Sure, A
          soak in a nice hot bath sounded supreme on a chilly night like this. He was likely already in the dog house no
          matter what actions preceded the following moments. The final redeeming factor was to be home before sunrise
          with one hell of an apology meal.</p>

        <p>Steady his loafers caught onto the old wood, grappling his body against the bark. The coarse body met his own
          in contact, jacket slipping along the jagged teeth of mother earth while snaking his way up the trunk. It
          wasn’t so long ago that boyhood memories of climbing trees for forts and exploration had left him entirely.
          The instinct still throbbed within his heart, old lessons taught by no one shining bright in moments of
          unexpected examination. Inch by inch, his body warped against every inch to maintain a steady advance to the
          solemn branch of freedom, careful movements to shift the vertical motion to that of a shimmy. Gentle as waves
          against a smooth tide, heels wrapped in unity while leaving the outer side of the fence behind him. A
          glistening pool of beautiful water teased below the detective now, scents of fresh springs bringing excitement
          to his aching image. The easy part lied ahead now, simply having to swing from the secondary entry a moment
          before plummeting to the polished stone with a quiet click. Just like that, he was in another stranger’s house
          without a reason.</p>

        <p>“ Alright, your turn. “</p>

        <p>Hands pat against his jacket to pull a smoke only to find his pack was in the hands of another. Gotta be more
          careful about the gifts you give.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong><u>Haru</u></strong></p>
        <p>Pain.</p>
        <p>No matter what way you try to surmise the situation, a few bullets in the side never amounts to anything but
          pain. Beige walls and cheap appliances were hardly the comfort a late night injury needed. Hell, at least the
          room was covered.</p>
        <p>A slow drag from the menthol cigarette, Nakano tilted his head backwards while painting the roof with his
          heavy exhale.</p>

        <p>“ If you’d just pull the trigger, they wouldn’t. “</p>

        <p>Easy words from the uninjured party. Aggravated digits twitched for a simple drag from the cigarette wedged
          between the bosses fingertips. With a chuckle, Nakano replied his baited request with a pass of the smoke.
          Eager lips wrapped around the device for a slow yet satisfied drag, blowing out the plume before the fumes had
          a chance to taint his lungs further. Coughing followed the satisfaction, Amusing the kingpin even further as
          his pen scratched the final details onto a hotel napkin. With a simple exchange, the cigarette was passed to
          the owner with a folded receipt between two fingers as a payment for the return.</p>

        <p>“ Call Haruhi-Chan. She’s up, I’m sure. “</p>

        <p>A silent nod in return to the boss while he spun on a heel, pleasantries had cleary finished his portion of
          this business. The thank you’s and words of affirmation had been dealt with, leaving Haru with a few wounds
          and the lifeline on the other end of a simple text. With a wave, Nakano gave a simple wave while the trail of
          smoke followed his casual walk into the empty hallway within the suite. Self sufficiency was a key benefit
          under the tree of benefits of Yakuza work, and having a tailored doctor only a phone-call away seemed far too
          convenient. Luckily, he remembered he girl that worked miracles on a few men closer to him. The medic tied to
          the boss in an unspoken way, pulling strings without being involved. Black hair, Magenta hues that danced
          within her eyes of mystery. It would be nice to have a moment to see exactly what she was capable of, and who
          exactly she was. Seeing Haruhi around the office was different, her busy pace and tired demeanor always
          deterring a conversation or approach. This time, his wounds would be a necessary ice breaker as they needed
          pretty immediate attention. Settled on the reality, his fingers pressed into the bright handheld in the shaded
          overnight room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>340 Shimi Circle, Shibuya</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>Three bullets, Stable, Safe room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Was that the right way to word that? The phone slapped against his forehead as his mind traced around the
          words he sent. It was so late already, his manners shouldn’t come across as those of the flock. She could have
          been sleeping, but the blood that pooled against these ivory towels against his stomach begged to urge her
          quick arrival.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>Sorry for the late call. It’s important.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The phone once again found its place against his flat brow, returning a few kisses to the eyebrows with each
          consecutive slap. What an idiot! At this rate, she is going to think someone is pranking her. What were the
          chances of a doctor even showing up past midnight anyway? The chances of living with a few impacts like this
          were pretty high to be honest. That said, the discomfort of a few wads of iron in the side really make for a
          shitty night’s sleep.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Haruhi</u></strong></p>
        <p>Bitters breed a certain sweetness when covering a gaping wound. Of all the masks to wear, hers <i><strong>s l
          i c k s</strong></i> onto the suppleness of her cheeks like honey coats a sore throat. Subtle, but distinct.
          When counting the empty glasses, you measure the thickness of her new skin; yet another failed attempt to
          extinguish&nbsp; a roaring flame with gasoline as the only option.</p>

        <p>Muffled sounds envelop surroundings, hardly more than warbled echoes lost from above the liquor lake. What’s
          going on around her doesn’t matter, not anymore. All that’s left is to let the world grow quiet for the night;
          let alcohol numb yet another palate.</p>

        <p><i>[And just how will this make the pain any more palatable, dove?]</i></p>

        <p>It’s called contempt.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Wait, no, that’s wrong.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>It’s called disappointment.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Fire dribbles down her throat as though it’s soothing—&nbsp; as though it’s comfort, not some scalding
          concoction brushing against tender tissue. As time moves in its rigid locomotion, her drinks devolve from
          cocktails to neat straight-pours of the shelve’s finest. Anything to keep from ruminating.</p>

        <p><i>Bzzzzt!&nbsp;</i></p>

        <p><i>Bzzzzt!</i></p>

        <p>Fuck.&nbsp; Just as she escaped the devil’s grasp, he drags her back down to hell aga—Hold on.</p>

        <p>Time halts and the beat of a drum rolls along her bones. Each thrash of her heart holds fast within its
          fragile cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[UNKNOWN NUMBER]</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spring hues trace the curves of each enigmatic number. Careful are the words digitally-etched and barely
          decipherable by blurred vision and hazy inebriation:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>340 Shimi Circle, Shibuya</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>Three bullets, Stable, Safe room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rational parts of her psyche sit as a captive audience; she’s not fit for spelunking in someone's gut for
          bullet fragments. Not even in the slightest, but obligation barrels itself to the forefront of her mind time
          and time again.</p>
        <p><i><strong>Bzzzt!&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>[SMS] </strong>Sorry for the late call. It’s important.</p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><i>...Sorry?</i>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One word is all it takes for the paradigm to shift.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>If there’s anything she’s sure of, it’s that she has no<i> fucking clue</i> who’s waiting for her. These
          texts definitely aren’t from any of her usual clientele. Toiling anger washes away; it’s all inconsequential
          now. She’s got work to do and double-vision to conquer. A slap of some handful of yen resonates within her
          favorite hole-in-the-wall when the back-alley medic leaves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">— — —&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He —whoever he is— should be counting himself lucky to be holed up some place close to where she lives.
          Grateful, even.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the span of five minutes, Haruhi’s feet somehow manage to navigate the streets, traversing the swimming
          vertigo of a typical drunk until she’s made it to her dainty apartment. Medical bag deftly slung over her
          shoulder, adrenaline cleanses the doctor of the sludge dredging within intoxicated veins with every step,
          until the viper sees with all its senses. Chemicals combust and hormones heal, churning through and filtering
          a muddled mind until she’s thinking clearly—&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A nearby bush catches a flood of bile as she heaves. Running like this isn’t doing her haggard, drunk self
          any favors.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the medic, she’s vomiting at the very entrance to the designated place. Some dingy, rundown
          establishment lays itself before her, and soon thereafter, the suite’s door matches her current constitution:
          lackluster and ramshackled.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">— — —&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The heavy metal swings open easily underneath her body’s weight, revealing what most would call a gruesome,
          harrowing scene. She just calls it Thursday. For whatever reason, the scent reminds her of her boss.</p>
        <p>She scans the man through a veil of fatigue and remnant poison. She’s seen him before, remembering how his
          composure mirrored the placidity of Nakano himself. This guy; he’s kempt in a way she doesn’t expect despite
          his predicament, and the expression he’s wearing differs from the yelling entitlement she’s used to being
          greeted with.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His pain is calm, and so is she.</p>

        <p>“Hope the other guy looks worse than you do,” she slurs with a casual whistle.</p>

        <p>Her satchel drops beside him, and all it takes is seconds to assess his wounds with the feather-light
          pressure of her fingertips against crimson-stained flesh. Not the worst she’s seen, but certainly not
          pretty.</p>

        <p>“Guessin’ Nakano-san threw my number in your direction, huh? Better count yourself lucky that’m even in the
          area.” She trips over the words while making menial conversation, but her hands move deftly, like those of
          someone who’s done this no less than one thousand times. The doc hopes she passes as at least <i>somewhat </i>sober,
          but the sway and stumble of her speech is hardly helping her case.</p>

        <p>“Slight pinch, hold your breath.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p><i>Understatement of the century.</i> Forceps dig into the first of three holes to litter his side. Metal
          grinds against metal as she rips lingering fragments delicately; probably best to distract him as she works.
          “Think I’ve seen you around before. Another one of the Nakano-kai hounds, right? Surprised we haven’t had a
          chance to get acquainted in <i>this </i>way ‘til now.”</p>

        <p>Talented <i>and</i> easy on the eyes. Now isn't that something.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He must be pretty good at his job if that’s the case. Another shard is yanked from his oblique and added to a
          growing pile. The furrowed brows and unintentional force she uses probably comes from the lingering agitation
          still in her system, (<i>maybe </i>the drinks), so striking conversation is a mutually beneficial distraction.
          “Got a name?”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Haru</u></strong></p>
        <p>Is...she drunk?</p>
        <p>The question lies obvious with the stink of liquor that coated each word she uttered, not to be curtailed by
          a light sway and slur. This must've been some kind of interruption unless this state is how she found herself
          every evening. Clumsy and inarticulate, the conversation remained one-sided from the moment she stumbled into
          the hotel room. His charcoal eyes opened to catch a glimpse of soft remarks through each delicate fumble to
          provide tender care. Tender wouldn’t be the word to use, however. From the moment of arrival, the female
          showed signs of an ill night with a shot to carry. I’m sure any housecall like this would put a doctor in a
          sour mood, but this evening seemed to carry a bit more weight than a late phone call.</p>

        <p>She drew close with her tools in hand, rambling as she prepared to operate on the man. Scents overwhelming
          took sides amongst the nostrils with lavender and barrel aged whiskey. It hung heavy across her rose lips,
          those of which continued to pour forth against his bare chest. The doctor’s breath was hot, plumes heating his
          already fevered skin. The reasoning behind her permanent contract was no longer a mystery.</p>

        <p>A sharp range of agitations would normally send a spine an order of erection, billowing pain laying over his
          side like a blanket of gas clouds. It wasn’t It burned against the cold steel digging into his side, lurching
          and squeezing against his pink flesh. The blood that once found a home within now poured from his peach
          carafe, staining the oxford shirt even further. She was precise, but without care. Given her state of mind, an
          unreal constitution would be the only factor able to perform. Melodies against the small tray, his marriage
          with the fragments ended in separation. While his well-being was in the hands of a drunk, he managed to cope
          as progress showed itself around the effervescent corner.</p>

        <p>“ Haru. “</p>

        <p>He spoke softly as to not interrupt her, a voice that mimicked the sound of mossy stones in a labyrinth.
          Slender fingers reached down to a fresh bottle of junmai sake, twisting the cap loose from the neck with
          pinched digits. A slow and long drink from the bottle was enough to subdue his pain, allowing the composure to
          remain as calm as the waters in a still bath. Feeling the tongs scrape against his ribcage wasn’t exactly
          pleasant, And her consistent nagging bore a hole in the mood. What mood could exist in a back alley surgery
          however aside from necessity and patience? He hoped for at least some different banter. She was here to do her
          job, leave her to it.</p>

        <p>There were other notes within the flowery aroma that coated the room with surprise. She wasn’t exactly suited
          up for the night alone. Even a modest scan could catch the slight cleavage that hung open from her bent form,
          a classy jazz in her step and glossy lips smacking between the sharp words. She was meeting someone. That
          someone never showed up. It was either that, or the clubs don’t know when to cut a girl off. A dancefloor
          doesn’t usually put one in this type of mood, however. He let out a soft sigh while returning to his shut-eyed
          state of waiting. All just a guess, but at least it was passing the time.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Haruhi</u></strong></p>
        <p>“Haru.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Huh?—Oh.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p><i>Whoops</i>. She almost takes his response as a call for her attention, almost takes it as an old sobriquet
          softly scraping against the last remnants of a distant memory. For every new year separating her from
          <i>his </i>death, the syllables still ring like the bittersweet bells of another funeral. But it’s his name,
          not hers, that Haru gives. It’s only now that she takes the time to actually pause, waterfall words crashing
          abruptly into an imbibed pool.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>He’s not a man of many words.</p>

        <p style="text-align:right;">Guess it’s hard to be one when there’s always a drink against chapped
          lips.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><i>[Well, isn’t this familiar?]</i></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not like she’s one to talk. In fact—&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The bourbon kisses softly now. Whatever rampage caged inside of her exists soon dissolves within absorbed
          toxins, pulling pretty lashes lower and promising that things will get better. Things <i>have</i> gotten
          better. Alcohol’s latent ability to make everything <s>not</s> okay never ceases to amaze. It’s a wonder how
          she hasn’t delved into the depths of alcoholism yet.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Ah, you’re <i>that </i>guy, eh?”</p>

        <p>The corner of her lips tugs into a lazy grin; it’s not that she means to sound presumptuous, but all control
          was left back at the bar, and there’s a certain ease the doctor feels in his presence. She’s heard of him
          before— usually with annoyance coating the tip of her boss's tongue when he’s venting over drinks. It’s not
          often that the man before her is the focal point of conversation, but it was always enough to garner her
          growing interest. Names spread like wildfire when the subject doesn’t belong within the ranks of the vile.
          (After all, she would know.) Her hands retreat while glassy hues chase up the length of him, catching his
          gaze.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>For a moment, it’s quiet in the best way. He’s one of the few who <i>gets </i>it. Right?</p>

        <p>He’s something new, something fresh, yet chillingly familiar. Or maybe, he’s just a special kind of idiot.
          Seriously, what man gets himself involved with Tokyo’s most hardened family while having convictions like
          <strong>that</strong>? But now the question is there, no different from necrosis gnawing at her raised flesh.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><i>[Who is he <strong>really</strong>?]</i></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A certain clarity parts the tendrils of fog still vexing her mind. What rough motions she started with begin
          to soften — breaking way to the benevolence she’s known for. It’s not painless, but it is gentle. It
          <i>is </i>careful (mostly), and diligent. A thin veneer of patience polishes her work with every stitch sewn
          and bullet wound dressed. Her movements orchestrate themselves through their own finesse —&nbsp; a soul living
          among the tips of a tender touch.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><i>T i n d e r,&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p><i>igniting within the friction of&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p><i>gauze wrapped along the ripples&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p><i>of his skin.&nbsp;</i></p>

        <p>“There, that should do it.” The floor creaks subtly when she leans back. Satisfied enough, Haruhi wipes the
          soft sheen collecting on her brow.&nbsp; “I’d tell you to take it easy for the next few weeks, but it’s not
          like anyone ever listens to me anyway.”</p>
        <p><strong>Bitter </strong>hardly describes the way the words spill out. Although, she has to admit, his
          tolerance for pain almost rivals her tolerance for bullshit; maybe he knows what he’s doing.</p>

        <p>Besides, it’s not like <i>she </i>knows much of anything about him, outside of assumptions. Who is she to say
          that they are that much alike at all? Violence isn’t the only sin to plague this city; their family deals in
          deaths, and trades by theft. The demons she encounters come with many masks, but why does she always find the
          ones whose facades are the most well-dressed?&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><i>[Which mask is he wearing?]</i></p>

        <p>It’s pointless to make baseless assumptions, yet there’s a peculiar attachment that tells her something:</p>

        <p>He doesn’t belong.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><i>(Neither does she.)</i></p>
        <p>He doesn’t deserve this pain.</p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><i>(Neither does she.)</i></p>
        <p>He shouldn't be here.</p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><i><strong>(Neither should she.)</strong></i></p>

        <p>Down, down, down, the drinks bury her in a hole of her own creation— an abyss with seemingly no exit, nor
          remorse for the weight of the soliloquy bestowed upon her. No, no. This is all just the kind of nonsense
          fueled by a long night of liquid lullabies. If she’s not filling the space between them with her own rambling
          voice, she’ll keep falling.</p>

        <p>And that is exactly why she’s split— calm waves call from another shore, Distraction just a soothing siren
          begging for her attention. No one wants to dwell on sour thoughts; <i>it's only natural</i> to turn to a new
          comfort in the wake of a storm. A part of her is trying to escape the ocean, and where she lands is awash the
          coastline of foreign territory.</p>

        <p><i>Petals fall in transience—&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
        <p><i>It’s only natural.</i></p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><u>Haru</u></strong></p>
        <p><i>One of those guys?</i></p>

        <p>Was she just saying the first thing that came to mind from the seeping whiskey or was it something else?
          Something else.</p>

        <p>What kind of stuck up, precious little bitch was he dealing with? Immediate thoughts of anger rushed into his
          swollen cavity of a head, oatmeal sloshing around as brain matter to formulate ways to stay calm. He had been
          with this family for quite some time now, the embrace of loving parental figures in the forms of blades and
          bones. She was special, and always rumored with a temper to boot. Better not fan those flames and just take it
          as a joke.</p>

        <p>If the carpet wasn’t absorbent, they could have been drowning by now. There was no jokes to be said in this
          moment. Her poisonous sadness poured as it puddled around soles of leather and twine. It was nothing like
          water, thick and viscous like a mucus of negative energy. A chakra so loathing that it could bury the weak
          before even calling the curtains. His heartbeat felt faint, ready to pull in the blood and let veins run blue
          and dry. There was a power in her death, stronger pulling towards the grave without an excuse to die. How was
          the dirt pulling him under without a convincing reason to lay to rest?. There were many dead bodies dragging
          feet across this landscape of tormility. A blink only bats away the evil for a second, a temporary flashback
          to the time you were asleep. All to suddenly, the reality is presented to us all, the repeating moment of
          tranquility that every soul must suffer through. It’s bleak out there, and the sunlight only gets brighter
          with age. Her presence was the moon, a pale horizon coating this towering city with a veil of grey. There used
          to be sunshine in that cage. The warmth was still vibrant along those cotton sleeves, brushing against the
          corridors with heat.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Her anguish was real, and it was toxic. The water wasn’t even fit to drink in this room anymore.</p>

        <p>His fingers reached forward while the pale figure of what used to be his medic stared blankly at the ground.
          As if rigor mortis began to set in, her movements became sluggish and impared. A cheerful drunk now nothing
          but stone under a blanket of moss and filthy breath. The beauty was etched away by worry and regret, a frown
          turning such a beautiful smile into something else. Something else. Before, a match would dance at the mere
          linger of her breath. Now, only a push of the flame from soft blows.</p>

        <p>The previous words still rang loudly in his head like marbles against the tile. He was one of the guys who
          gets it. She hit the nail on the head, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>He understands that everyone thinks they are the ones who have it so rough because the only life they have
          ever experienced was their own. People could look at the experiences and stories of one another and try to
          bring empathy on a platter, but it never quite covered the feast. They would never know your pain. You would
          never know their pain. Standing before the reaper only makes the winter against your breath more bearable.</p>

        <p>No one deserves this pain. They weren’t special. She was just upset about something, that much was clear.
          What was the difference?</p>

        <p>Closer peers across her pale complexion revealed what concerned him. It was the look that painted her face.
          It was a unique kind of stare, fit with the weight of more than this world was able to cough up. Hours of
          struggle and stress would shiver at the dead eyes before him, a frightened tingle pecking at his spine like a
          woodpecker. Tunneling into his marrow, infesting the lining of tissue with ticks and insects to feed.&nbsp;
          Why was this creeping across her brow at this hour? A stood-up date would never conjure this kind of curse
          unless she was absolutely out of her mind. Then again, who said a late-night doctor for the Yakuza on speed
          dial was all there? Maybe some questions are better left unanswered.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i>Was she</i></p>
        <p style="text-align:right;"><i><strong>Danger</strong> in the same sense?</i></p>
        <p style="text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What was danger to them? They lived in the very idea. Was danger only something that existed to those outside
          from this world? Is death the punishment for a mistake in their world? It was difficult to imagine a world
          without the danger that they shared. Watering your fern in the morning, and baking some cookies in the
          evening. A life without running from your own decisions, sleeping without the fear of being woken to cold
          steel against your cheek. This head was temporary, flesh in service to a higher power only to be discarded
          when the warranty runs out. That contract is not negotiable, but is subjective to the owner. Could it be how
          she felt like property, or something else? Something else.</p>

        <p>This girl was in a real battle with her mind, and he was the only person standing between an infinite regress
          into madness and some helpful clarity. An intervention wasn’t only the correct thing to do, but necessary if
          he ever wanted to prove to himself that being a better person meant caring for the outcome of others. Enough
          philosophy, this girl could use a shoulder for the time being.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>He shouldn’t waste seconds overthinking some simple things in life. Sometimes, people just have a bad night
          and could use a hand.</p>

        <p>A quick snap of the fingers would be the only attempt at a separation. Even if she could have used another
          moment for recollection, this was not the place to be having any such thing. A late night vending machine
          sandwich was a much better idea than moping around in a room the entire clan knows the address of. There was
          no telling when they could return, and her solemn moment should be interrupted by a friendly face in the very
          least. Softly, the words fell from chapped lips onto the floor.</p>
